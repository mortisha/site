		<h2> OUR PHILOSOPHY </h2>
		<p>
			We believe that childhood is a celebration, and the colorful prints and cute characters we design are inspired by the joy and love children bring into our lives. We celebrate childhood by supporting babies, children, and families with thoughtful designs, quality materials and construction, and convenient shopping options.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
			You can count on SMILE to take care of the little details so that you are free to focus on what really matters: celebrating your little one – and the hugs, cuddles, giggles, and babbles that light up our lives.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
			Throughout the years, SMILE has been known for its thoughtful little details like the Handi-Cuff mitten sleeve that protects babies from self-scratching, and the Jiffon neck design that slips over little ears for easy outfit changes – and although we’ve grown a lot since the early days, we stay true to the philosophy that earned us the trust of generations of families.
